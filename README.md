# WebGPU Guide

Based on the walkthrough by Elie Michel from the online guide at [https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/](https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/)

## Additional dep versions

These don't need to be installed as a system dependency, instead they're added as Git submodules and included as additional CMake projects
